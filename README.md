AndroidTipCalculator
====================

Tip calculator for android which calculates tip with or without tax and amount each person pays. 
App is available on the Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.morphzelous.splitntip&hl=en.

It calculates the total tip and also the tip each person pays depending on the number of splits.
Users can round-up or round-down the calculation to get the whole number.

I created my own input buttons using xml instead of using the android keyboard so that the buttons match the holo dark theme of the app.
